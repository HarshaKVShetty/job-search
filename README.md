# SearchEngine

Poject Name: SearchEngine

Assumptions made:
1. The provoded api endpoint was not able to reach because of authentication, so used local json file for data (Hope this is fine).

Executing the project:
cd search-engine/
npm install
npm start (for local json host, to be running in one terminal)
ng serve -o

Unit testing:
ng test
